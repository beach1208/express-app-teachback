# CircleCI Teachback

This repo will be used for TSM's to practice implementing CircleCI features on a basic Node application. We will meet as a group and have the TSMs explain how they implemented these features. 

## Objectives

The objective of this activity is to have TSMs practice implementing the following:

- Test splitting 
- Contexts
